# Introduction

The Button Box is made up of a series of switches, which can be used to make certain controls of the ship "more physical", thus facilitating the piloting of the ship in Star Citizen. For example, it can be used to raise and lower the landing gear, to turn the ship on and off, to lower and raise the shields and everything else you want.

The keypad looks like the following:

It is composed of a series of switches as seen in the following detail:

The Button Box has very few buttons, only six, but is easily extendable to more switches.

The Button Box is connected by USB cable to the PC and the computer recognizes it as a joystick with only buttons, without axes, without conflicting with other connected devices, but on the contrary, complementing them.

The Button Box works for other PC games that work with Joystick, but I have not tried them with other games.
